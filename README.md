# pokersim (WIP)

</div>

use brute force simulation to determine probabilities of outcomes for given
hole cards in texas hold'em

simulate dealing, categorize and count occurrences of hands, report
probabilities

throughout development, I am looking for opportunities to exercise language
features I am not practiced with, specifically template programming.
