#### Hole Cards Win Probability 

This will be a program that uses simulation to report the win probability for
every combination of hole cards. 

Over a given number of rounds and for a given number of opponents, `pokersim` 
will simulate a round from flop to river, keeping track of which set of hole 
cards ended up winning the round. 

This answers questions like 
- What are the best hole cards possible? (definitely AA)
- What are the worst hole cards possible?
- Is it better to have suited or unsuited hole cards?
- Is it even worth paying to see the flop (given my hole cards)?
- Should I even be playing poker?
